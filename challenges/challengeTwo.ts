/**
 * PART 2
 *
 * You purchase an energy-saving device for your appliance in order
 * to cut back on its energy usage. The device is smart enough to shut
 * off the appliance after it detects some period of disuse, but you
 * can still switch on or off the appliance as needed.
 *
 * You are keen to find out if your shiny new device was a worthwhile
 * purchase. Its success is measured by calculating the amount of
 * energy *saved* by device.
 *
 * To assist you, you now have a new event type that indicates
 * when the appliance was switched off by the device (as opposed to switched
 * off manually). Your new states are:
 * * 'on'
 * * 'off' (manual switch off)
 * * 'auto-off' (device automatic switch off)
 *
 * (The `profile` structure is the same, except for the new possible
 * value for `initial` and `state`.)
 *
 * Write a function that calculates the *energy savings* due to the
 * periods of time when the device switched off your appliance. You
 * should not include energy saved due to manual switch offs.
 *
 * You will need to account for redundant/non-sensical events e.g.
 * an off event after an auto-off event, which should still count as
 * an energy savings because the original trigger was the device
 * and not manual intervention.
